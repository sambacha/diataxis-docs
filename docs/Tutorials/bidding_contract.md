mevETH is an upcoming MEV-optimized, natively multichain liquid staking protocol.

It is designed capture MEV from sources unavailable to other liquid staking platforms, which are available to mevETH because Manifold operates the entire Ethereum validation stack—block builder, relay, and validators—thus unlocking novel and sophisticated MEV approaches that wouldn’t otherwise be possible. mevETH will also be the first natively multichain liquid staking token, leveraging LayerZero technology to maximize DeFi composability across chains. 

As announced in [The Block](https://www.theblock.co/post/224570/manifold-cream-finance-deal), mevETH will launch with over 25,000 ETH that will be transitioned from C.R.E.A.M. Finance’s crETH2 liquid staking platform into mevETH, with special incentives provided for existing crETH2 holders. A portion of revenue generated by the mevETH protocol will accrue to Manifold’s FOLD token via a new staking system.
